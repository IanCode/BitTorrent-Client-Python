#Python Bittorrent Client#

##By Ian White##

This is a basic bittorrent client written in python. It only downloads and cannot seed a file, and also lacks multi threaded downloading which is a major strength of bittorrent. This functionality could be easily implemented now that the basic handshake and message formats have all been figured out.
